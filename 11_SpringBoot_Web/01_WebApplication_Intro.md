# Building Web Applications with Servlets and Spring

## Introduction to Web Applications

In the realm of web development, Spring serves as an umbrella framework encompassing various projects, particularly geared towards web applications. Whether you opt for Spring Web or Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller), the objective remains consistent: facilitating the creation of robust web servers that handle client requests efficiently.

### Why Web Applications?

Web applications serve as the backbone for both desktop and mobile frontends. They enable dynamic content delivery, ensuring personalized experiences for users through server-side processing. While static content suffices for basic display, dynamic content necessitates backend logic, often implemented in Java.

### Role of Servlets

Servlets are fundamental components in Java web development, responsible for processing and responding to HTTP requests from clients. They operate within a servlet container, like Apache Tomcat, which facilitates their execution.

### Understanding Servlet Containers

Servlet containers provide the runtime environment necessary for servlet execution. Tomcat, known for its lightweight nature and robust performance, stands as a popular choice for deploying servlet-based applications.

### Getting Started with Servlets

1. **Servlet Basics**:

   - Servlets are Java classes that extend the capabilities of servers to handle requests.
   - They are configured within a web.xml deployment descriptor or annotated directly with `@WebServlet` in modern Java EE environments.

2. **Servlet Lifecycle**:

   - Initialization, service, and destruction phases define how servlets handle incoming requests and manage resources.
   - `doGet()` and `doPost()` methods are typically overridden to handle specific HTTP methods.

3. **Servlet Containers**:
   - Tomcat serves as a servlet container, handling servlet execution within a web application context.

### Transition to Spring

While servlets directly manage HTTP requests, frameworks like Spring simplify web application development. Spring MVC abstracts servlet interactions, offering higher-level abstractions for routing, handling requests, and managing dependencies.

### Conclusion

Starting with servlets provides foundational knowledge in web application development using Java. Understanding servlets lays the groundwork for transitioning to frameworks like Spring, enhancing productivity and scalability in building robust web applications.

In subsequent modules, we'll delve into practical implementations with servlets and then explore advanced features leveraging Spring frameworks for web development.
