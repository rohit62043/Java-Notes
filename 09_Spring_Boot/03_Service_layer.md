# Creating Layers in Spring Application

## Overview

In a Spring application, we organize our code into layers to maintain separation of concerns and improve maintainability. These layers typically include the model, service, and repository layers.

### Model Package

First, let's create a `model` package to house our entity classes, such as `Laptop`, `Desktop`, etc. These classes represent the entities that will be stored in the database.

### Service Layer

Next, we create a `service` package where we implement the business logic of our application. The service layer is responsible for processing data and performing operations that are not related to direct database access.

### Stereotype Annotations

- **@Component**: Marks a class as a Spring-managed component.
- **@Service**: Specialized version of `@Component` for service layer components. It clarifies that the annotated class is a service component.

### Example: Service Layer

#### LaptopService Class

```java
package com.example.service;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class LaptopService {

    public boolean addLaptop(Laptop laptop) {
        // Perform some processing logic here
        System.out.println("Method called: addLaptop");
        return true;
    }

    // Other business logic methods can be added here
}
```
