### Understanding Spring Security Filters

In this segment, we delve into the mechanics of Spring Security filters and their role in processing requests and enforcing security measures within our Spring Boot application.

#### Introduction to Filters

1. **Filter Chain Concept:**

   - Similar to Servlet filters, Spring Security employs a chain of filters that intercept requests before they reach the application's controllers.
   - Filters operate sequentially, with each filter potentially modifying or blocking the request before passing it to the next filter in the chain.

2. **Default Filter Configuration:**
   - Upon integrating Spring Security, several default filters are automatically applied:
     - `DefaultSecurityFilterChain`: Represents the chain of security filters.
     - `DisableEncodeUrlFilter`, `WebAsyncManagerIntegrationFilter`, `ContextHolderFilter`: Examples of filters in the chain.
     - Filters for CORS, CSRF protection, authentication (login/logout), and more are included.
3. **Filter Execution Order:**

   - Filters are executed in a specific order predefined by Spring Security.
   - Each filter performs a specific security-related task, such as handling authentication, authorization, session management, or request validation.

4. **Customizing Filter Order:**
   - While possible to customize the filter chain order, it's typically unnecessary and not recommended unless specific security requirements dictate otherwise.

#### Practical Application

1. **Request Processing Flow:**

   - When a request is made to the application, it first enters the Spring Security filter chain.
   - Filters process the request sequentially, applying security checks and validations as configured.

2. **Session Management:**
   - Spring Security manages sessions automatically upon successful authentication.
   - Users remain authenticated until they explicitly log out or their session expires, allowing seamless access to application resources without repeated logins.

#### Conclusion

Understanding Spring Security filters provides insights into how Spring Boot applications handle security at a fundamental level. In upcoming sessions, we'll explore specific filters in more detail, including their configuration and customization options, to tailor security measures according to application requirements.
