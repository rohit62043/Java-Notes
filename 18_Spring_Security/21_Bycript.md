### Understanding Password Security Issues

- **Current Problem**:
  - Currently, passwords are stored in plain text in the database.
  - Data transmission also occurs in plain text, which is insecure.

### Cryptography Concepts

- **Encryption and Decryption**:

  - **Encryption**: Process of encoding data so that only authorized parties can access it.
  - **Decryption**: Process of decoding encrypted data back into its original form.

- **Hashing**:
  - **One-Way Encryption**: Hashing is a technique where data is transformed into a fixed-size string of characters, which is irreversible.
  - Example: Converting "h@123" to a hash value like "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99".

### Choosing a Secure Hashing Algorithm

- **Common Algorithms**:

  - MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc.
  - Prefer SHA-256 for better security, but it's vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

- **Enhanced Hashing with Bcrypt**:
  - Bcrypt is a password hashing function designed to be slow and computationally expensive.
  - **Salting**: Automatically included in Bcrypt to prevent attacks like rainbow table attacks.
  - **Adjustable Cost Factor (Rounds)**: Determines how computationally expensive the hash function is.

### Using Bcrypt in Spring Boot

- **Integration Steps**:

  - **Dependency**: Ensure Bcrypt dependency is included in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-security-crypto</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

- **PasswordEncoder Interface**:
  - Spring Security provides `PasswordEncoder` interface to handle password hashing and verification.

### Example of Bcrypt Password Generation

- **Online Tools**:
  - Demonstrated generating Bcrypt hashes using online tools.
  - Example: Inputting "h@123" and receiving Bcrypt hash `$2a$12$SomeHashString`.

### Implementing Bcrypt in Your Application

- **Update User Registration**:
  - Modify user registration process to use Bcrypt to hash passwords before storing in the database.

### Benefits of Bcrypt

- **Enhanced Security**:
  - Bcrypt provides a high level of security against brute-force attacks.
  - Slow hashing process increases computational difficulty for attackers.

### Next Steps

- **Implementation in Code**:
  - Implement `PasswordEncoder` in `UserService` to hash passwords before saving to database.
  - Update existing user records to hash passwords during migration.

### Conclusion

Implementing Bcrypt in your application significantly enhances password security by storing hashed passwords rather than plaintext. This approach mitigates risks associated with data breaches and ensures compliance with security best practices.
