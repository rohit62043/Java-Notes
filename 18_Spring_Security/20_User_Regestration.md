## Implementing User Registration and Saving to Database

### Overview

In this section, we focused on enabling user registration functionality in the project. This involved creating a `UserController` to handle registration requests, implementing a `UserService` to save user data to the database using `UserRepo`, and testing the registration functionality using Postman.

### Steps and Components Implemented

1. **UserController Setup:**

   - Created a `UserController` class annotated with `@RestController`.
   - Implemented a `register` endpoint using `@PostMapping` to handle registration requests.
   - Used `@RequestBody` to accept a `User` object for registration.
   - Returned the registered `User` object back to the client.

2. **UserService Implementation:**

   - Created a `UserService` class annotated with `@Service`.
   - Implemented a `saveUser` method to save the user object received from the controller into the database using `UserRepo`.
   - Autowired `UserRepo` in `UserService` to perform database operations.

3. **Testing Registration Functionality:**

   - Used Postman to send registration requests to the `/register` endpoint.
   - Provided necessary user details such as username and password.
   - Verified successful registration by checking the response status (200 OK) and verifying data persistence in the database.

4. **Debugging and Fixes:**
   - Initially encountered issues with authentication due to incorrect password in Postman.
   - Corrected by providing the correct authorization details.
   - Ensured proper wiring of `UserService` in `UserController` for data persistence.

### Next Steps

The next objective is to implement password encryption using Bcrypt to enhance security by securely storing user passwords in the database. This will be covered in the upcoming video.

The project setup now includes basic user registration functionality integrated with database storage. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any part of the setup, feel free to ask!
