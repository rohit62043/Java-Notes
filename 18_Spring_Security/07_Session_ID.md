## Managing Sessions and Customizing Authentication in Spring Security

### Introduction

In this section, we've secured our application using Spring Security and accessed it with a default generated password. Now, I'll demonstrate how things are functioning.

### Accessing the Application

1. **Logging In:**

   - After retrieving the default password from the console, I logged into the application using the username 'user' and the generated password.
   - Navigated to a basic page at `/hello`, confirming access.

2. **Adding a New Endpoint:**

   - Expanded functionality by adding a new method in the controller to display information about a company (e.g., Telusko) at `/about`.

3. **Session Handling:**

   - Highlighted the importance of sessions in user experience:
     - Once logged in, users can access different resources without re-entering credentials.
     - Demonstrated session management by showing the session ID in the browser's network tab and explaining its role in maintaining user authentication state.

4. **Print Session ID:**
   - Used `HttpServletRequest` to print the session ID alongside responses from `/hello` and `/about`.
   - Noted that displaying session IDs publicly is a security risk and should be avoided in production environments.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Restarting the Application:**
  - Encountered the inconvenience of needing to copy the password after each application restart.
  - Addressed the need to customize username and password configuration for a better user experience.

### Next Steps

In the upcoming video, I'll explore how to configure custom username and password authentication, eliminating the need for the default generated password.
