## Accessing Resources with Basic Authentication

### Introduction

In this section, we explore accessing our application's resources using basic authentication from a REST client or a React application.

### Using Basic Authentication

1. **Scenario:**

   - Accessing endpoints (`/hello` and `/about`) from a REST client or React application using basic authentication instead of form-based authentication.

2. **Error Handling:**

   - Attempting to access the endpoint without authentication results in a `401 Unauthorized` error, indicating the need for proper authentication.

3. **Configuring Basic Authentication in Postman:**

   - Open Postman and navigate to the request settings.
   - Choose the `Authorization` tab and select `Basic Auth`.
   - Enter the username (`telusko`) and password (`1234`).

4. **Sending Requests:**

   - Send a GET request to `/hello` and `/about`.
   - Verify the responses to confirm access with a successful `200 OK` response.

5. **Security Considerations:**
   - **Password Encryption:** The demonstration uses plain-text passwords (`1234`), which is not secure for production environments.
   - **Secure Transmission:** Discuss the importance of encrypting passwords during transmission over the internet to prevent interception and decoding.

### Future Topics

- **Security Enhancements:**
  - Implementing password encryption and secure transmission methods (e.g., HTTPS) to safeguard sensitive information.
  - Exploring other authentication mechanisms like JWT for enhanced security and scalability.

### Conclusion

Basic authentication provides a straightforward method to authenticate requests from REST clients or React applications. However, ensuring password security and encrypted transmission are crucial for protecting sensitive data in real-world applications.
