## Project Overview and Security Configuration

### Introduction

In this section, we'll review the project setup focusing on security configuration using Spring Security with database authentication. The project uses PostgreSQL as the database and integrates with Spring Data JPA for database operations.

### Security Configuration

1. **Authentication Provider:**
   - Implemented `DaoAuthenticationProvider` to connect with the database.
   - Configured `userDetailsService` to utilize `MyUserDetailsService`, which implements `UserDetailsService`.
2. **UserDetailsService Implementation:**
   - Created `MyUserDetailsService` implementing `UserDetailsService`.
   - Implemented `loadUserByUsername` method to fetch user details from the database using `UserRepo`.
3. **User Entity and Repository:**

   - Defined `User` entity representing the `users` table in the database.
   - Created `UserRepo` extending `JpaRepository<User, Integer>` for database operations.

4. **UserPrincipal Implementation:**

   - Implemented `UserPrincipal` class implementing `UserDetails`.
   - Wrapped fetched `User` object into `UserPrincipal` to provide `UserDetails` interface implementation.

5. **Security Configuration Steps:**
   - Configured application properties (`application.properties`) for PostgreSQL database connection.
   - Updated XML configuration (`pom.xml`) to include dependencies like Spring Data JPA and PostgreSQL connector.

### Conclusion

The setup allows secure authentication of users against a PostgreSQL database using Spring Security. Key components such as `UserDetailsService`, `DaoAuthenticationProvider`, `UserPrincipal`, and `UserRepo` work together to ensure that user authentication is handled securely within the application.

Next steps involve enhancing security by encrypting passwords (currently stored in plaintext) and implementing additional security measures such as password expiration policies. These aspects will further strengthen the application's security posture.
