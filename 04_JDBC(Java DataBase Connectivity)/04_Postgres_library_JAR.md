# Setting up IntelliJ IDEA and Adding PostgreSQL JDBC Driver

To start coding with JDBC and PostgreSQL, follow these steps to set up IntelliJ IDEA and add the PostgreSQL JDBC driver to your project:

## Setting up IntelliJ IDEA:

1. **Download IntelliJ IDEA:**

   - Download and install IntelliJ IDEA, a popular IDE for Java development.
   - IntelliJ IDEA offers both a Community (free) and Ultimate (paid) version. The Community version suffices for this course.

2. **Create a New Project:**

   - Open IntelliJ IDEA and create a new project.
   - Name the project (e.g., "JdbcCourse"), select the project location, and choose the Java SDK.

3. **Select Build System:**
   - Choose the build system for the project. For this example, select IntelliJ.

## Adding PostgreSQL JDBC Driver:

1. **Download the JDBC Driver:**

   - Go to [jdbc.postgresql.org](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/) or [MVN Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/) to download the PostgreSQL JDBC driver.
   - Choose the appropriate version compatible with your PostgreSQL installation (e.g., 42.6.0).

2. **Add the JDBC Driver to IntelliJ:**
   - In IntelliJ IDEA, navigate to `File` > `Project Structure`.
   - Select `Libraries` and click on the `+` button to add a new library.
   - Choose `Java` and select the downloaded PostgreSQL JDBC driver JAR file.
   - Click `Apply` and then `OK` to add the driver to your project.

With these steps completed, your IntelliJ IDEA project is configured to work with JDBC and PostgreSQL. The PostgreSQL JDBC driver is added to the project, enabling database connectivity. Now you can proceed to write the JDBC code to connect your Java application with PostgreSQL.
