# Creating Your First Spring Boot Application

To get started with developing a Spring Boot application, we'll explore the steps involved in setting up your project using Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.

## Using Eclipse

1. **Create a New Project**:

   - Open Eclipse and select "Create a new project".
   - Choose "Spring Starter Project" under "Spring Boot" and click "Next".
   - Configure your project details like name, group ID, artifact, etc.
   - Select Spring Boot version (e.g., 3.2) and skip adding any additional dependencies for now.
   - Click "Finish" to generate your Spring Boot project structure.

2. **Project Structure**:

   - Once generated, explore your project structure in Eclipse.
   - Open the `pom.xml` file to see the dependencies added by Spring Boot.

3. **Running the Application**:
   - Open the main application class.
   - Write a simple "Hello World" message to test if your application runs successfully.
   - Run the application and observe the Spring Boot banner and startup process.

## Using IntelliJ IDEA

1. **Generate Project from start.spring.io**:

   - IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition doesn't have built-in Spring Boot project templates, so you'll use `start.spring.io`.
   - Visit [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) in your browser.
   - Configure your project details similar to Eclipse setup (group, artifact, dependencies).
   - Download the generated zip file.

2. **Import Project into IntelliJ IDEA**:

   - Open IntelliJ IDEA and click "Open".
   - Navigate to the downloaded zip file and select it to import.
   - IntelliJ IDEA will import and configure the project structure automatically.

3. **Exploring the Project**:

   - Expand the project structure in IntelliJ IDEA to see the generated files and folders.
   - Open the `pom.xml` file to verify the dependencies, including Spring Boot and Spring Framework.

4. **Running the Application**:
   - Similar to Eclipse, open the main application class.
   - Add a "Hello World" message and run the application.
   - Observe the startup process and confirm that your Spring Boot application runs successfully.

## Conclusion

Setting up a Spring Boot application can be done efficiently using IDEs like Eclipse with the Spring Boot plugin or IntelliJ IDEA with project generation from `start.spring.io`. Understanding this setup process is crucial as we prepare to implement Dependency Injection in the next tutorial.
