# Archetypes in Maven

- **Definition**: Maven provides archetypes, which are templating tools used to create project structures.
- **Purpose**: Archetypes streamline project setup by offering predefined templates for various project types.
- **Usage**:
  - Users can choose from existing archetypes or create custom ones.
  - Custom archetypes are beneficial for standardizing project structures within an organization.
- **Benefits**:
  - Standardizes project structures across multiple projects.
  - Simplifies project setup by providing predefined configurations and dependencies.

# Maven Functionality

- **Dependency Management**:
  - Maven handles dependencies, primarily JAR files, required for project development.
  - Users can specify dependencies in the project's POM.xml file.
- **Dependency Acquisition**:
  - Users can manually download JAR files from external sources and include them in the project.
  - Alternatively, Maven offers integration with repositories like Maven Central to automatically download dependencies.
- **Transitive Dependencies**:
  - Maven automatically manages transitive dependencies, ensuring that all required dependencies are included.
- **Project Object Model (POM)**:
  - POM.xml is the configuration file for Maven projects, containing project metadata and dependencies.
  - Key elements of POM.xml include group ID, artifact ID, and version for specifying dependencies.
  - Group ID ensures uniqueness by using a reverse domain name convention.
  - Artifact ID represents the project name, and version specifies the project version.
- **Adding Dependencies**:
  - Users can add dependencies to the project by specifying them in the dependencies section of the POM.xml file.
  - Dependencies can be copied from repositories like Maven Central and pasted into the POM.xml file.
- **Dependency Resolution**:
  - Maven resolves dependencies by fetching required JAR files from repositories specified in the POM.xml.
  - Users can trigger dependency resolution by refreshing or reloading Maven dependencies in the IDE.
- **Transitive Dependency Handling**:
  - Maven handles transitive dependencies automatically, ensuring that all dependencies required by the project's dependencies are included.
- **Sharing Projects**:
  - Sharing Maven projects is simplified since dependencies are managed via POM.xml.
  - Users can share the project's POM.xml file, and others can automatically download dependencies by reloading Maven.
