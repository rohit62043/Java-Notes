# Understanding Getter and Setter Methods

## Introduction

- In Java, getter and setter methods are used to access and modify the private variables of a class.
- While the convention is to use `getVariableName()` and `setVariableName()` for getters and setters respectively, other names can be used.

## Customizing Method Names

- It's possible to use custom names for getter and setter methods.
- For example, instead of `getAge()` and `setAge()`, one could use `abc()` and `xyz()`.
- However, using meaningful names improves code readability and understanding.

## Best Practices

- **Meaningful Names**: Method names should reflect their purpose for better readability.
- **Standard Convention**: The convention for getter methods is `getVariableName()` and for setter methods is `setVariableName()`.

## IDE Features

- Many IDEs offer automated generation of getter and setter methods.
- These methods adhere to the standard naming convention (`getVariableName()` and `setVariableName()`).

## Generating Getter and Setter Methods

- IDEs provide tools to generate getters and setters automatically.
- Simply right-click on the class, select "Source" or "Generate", and choose "Generate Getters and Setters".
- The generated methods follow the standard naming convention.

## Conclusion

- Getter and setter methods provide controlled access to private variables.
- Following naming conventions and using meaningful names enhances code readability and maintainability.
- IDEs offer convenient tools for generating these methods, streamlining the development process.
