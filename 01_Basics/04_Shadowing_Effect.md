- When a local variable has the same name as an instance variable within a class, it creates what is known as a "shadowing" effect. In this situation, the local variable takes precedence over the instance variable within the scope where it is defined.

- Here's an example to illustrate this concept:

```java
public class VariableExample {
    // Instance variable
    private int number = 10;

    // Method demonstrating shadowing
    public void shadowingExample() {
        // Local variable with the same name as the instance variable
        int number = 20;

        // Accessing the local variable
        System.out.println("Local variable: " + number);

        // Accessing the instance variable using the 'this' keyword
        System.out.println("Instance variable: " + this.number);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VariableExample example = new VariableExample();
        example.shadowingExample();
    }
}
```

- In this example:

- We have a class VariableExample with an instance variable number initialized to 10.
- Inside the shadowingExample method, we declare a local variable also named number and assign it the value 20.
- When we reference number within the method, it refers to the local variable, not the instance variable.
- This is because local variables take precedence over instance variables within their scope.
- We use the this keyword to explicitly refer to the instance variable within the class. This allows us to differentiate between the local variable and the instance variable with the same name.
- When the shadowingExample method is called, it prints the value of the local variable (20) and the instance variable (10), demonstrating the shadowing effect.
